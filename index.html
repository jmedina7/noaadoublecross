                <h3>What does it do?</h3>
                <p>Our setup allows us to receive the signals in which weather satellites
                    transmit, and record the audio which we hear. The WAV audio file is then
                    resampled, decoded, and then produces JPG images of the area!</p>

                <h3>How we built it</h3>
                <p>Our antenna is fashioned after a standard double-cross dipole antenna, with
                    each dipole measuring ~19". This is near the ideal length to receive frequencies
                    around 137MHz, which is where the US government's very own NOAA weather satellites
                    transmit. This double cross design takes two pairs of dipoles with different length
                    connections and effectively phases two signals onto each other. In theory, this
                    should allow our antenna to operate omnidirectionally.</p>

                <p>To build the antenna, I bought an software defined radio (SDR), which eliminates
                    both the cost and bulk of a radio more typical to HAM radio operations. SDRs instead
                    utilize software to control operating frequencies, gain, and many other functions
                    rather than using built-in tuning mechanisms. Our radio comes from RTL, and software
                    for this particular device was readily available to use. This radio has an impedance of
                    50 ohms, so I bought some cheap 50 ohm coaxial cable from Amazon to go with it.</p>

                <p>The harness itself is built from 3/4" PVC pipe, and holds the very shadily soldered
                    connections between each arm. The dipoles themselves are made from measuring tape
                    where ~1" of coating was sanded off for better connections with the coaxial cable.
                    The vast majority of the antenna is held together with a total of more than half a roll of
                    electrical tape.</p>

                <h3>What's next for Satellite Imagery</h3>
                <p>The next step in this project would be to create a sturdier and more permanent antenna. One of the
                    biggest flaws with the antenna was how wobbly the harness was and how flimsy the connections
                    between wires were. While I was still able to pull images from this set up, it is not suitable for
                    operation in precipitation and a support even broke throughout the night.</p>
                <p>With a studier antenna, I should be able to find a stronger signal more easily. Being able to
                    receive stronger signals from NOAA satellites allows you to pull additional telemetry data and
                    thermal images, in addition to receiving much higher resolution images. I should even be able to
                    access the METEOR M2 satellite with a better antenna, which broadcasts a digital frequency and
                    produces colored images.</p>
                <p>Having a network of people pulling images from these satellites can allow for more creative
                    results as well. For example, a composite image of Earth can be created with enough people and
                    if consistent, can produce a sort of "citizen's Google Earth."</p>
